# typerbot
I created a bot that utilizes web scraping to ace typing races!

Uploaded files:-

typingbot: includes the code for the bot to make it type when triggered
typer: includes the gui (graphical user interface) code that enables the bot to be displayed in a graphical form for an optimized user experience
waiter: includes the code that prints out the waiting time (in seconds) to the terminal as the bot waits to retrieve the text that is to be typed
fonts file: the files that enables the bot's text to be displayed in a specific font
background file: includes the image that is displayed as background for gui (graphical user interface) of the bot
icon file: includes the icon (top-left corner) of the bot's window (visible when the bot is running)


Note:- I DO NOT encourage cheating on typing races or tests; this project was created out of my sheer interest in high speed typing. It is only meant to be used with virtuous intentions. If you want to learn how to type fast, you got to put in the effort and time to actually learn the skill; using a typing bot might put you at the top of the leaderboard, but you will not actually be learning anything useful, rather, just wasting your time.
